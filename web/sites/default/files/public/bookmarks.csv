Deploying drupal ,2012-04-16 16:26 ,"Sam boyer explains how drupal.org uses all the best practices of continuous delivery.
http://denver2012.drupal.org/program/sessions/delivering-drupal
Brutal truth: as a community, Drupal's understanding is pathetically behind much of the world when it comes to devops and deployment. Most shops, and even many larger companies with dedicated Drupal teams, use one-off, unstructured, error-prone systems to get code from development to production. This is not OK. In my experience, these problems are cast under the umbrella of project management. As such, solutions tend to come in two forms:
Better project tracking software.
Better human communication.
Those things are important, but they really miss the big picture. At the end of the day, what matters is getting code from development to production - ""delivering"" it. Doing that properly means demystifying and solidifying the steps in that process, which entails tools like Git, Jenkins, Puppet/Chef, and Capistrano. Or, in a word: Devops. Building a system that can deliver code in a way that informs and includes all the relevant stakeholders, from developers to product owners, requires the right tools linked with the right mentality. In this session, we'll explore tools and mentality together."
