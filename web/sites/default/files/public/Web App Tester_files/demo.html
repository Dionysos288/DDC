  	<p><strong>Web App Tester</strong> is an easy way to test web-based 
applications at 320x480px. It is useful for testing how a website would 
work on devices like the iPhone or Android phones with similar 
dimensions.</p>
    
		<p>This application is very simple: an iframe can be updated using controls in the <strong>Web App Tester</strong>
 menu to navigate to URLs, or switch between landscape and portrait 
orientations. The iframe is 320x480px (or 480x320px in landscape mode). 
This application should work on your tablet device in both portrait and 
landscape orientation. There is a known issue that will not allow this 
project to work on the Apple iPad.</p>
    
		<p>The idea is that a properly sized viewport in combination with tap 
controls of a tablet should mimic the actual experience of devices like 
the iPhone. It's not perfect, but it is a place to start. This 
application will also work on desktops in Webkit browsers. Please note 
that scrollbars have been disabled, but scrolling is still permitted 
using a mousewheel/arrow keys.</p>
